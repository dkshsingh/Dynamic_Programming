# what is dynamic programmming?
    Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.
    Letâ€™s take the example of the Fibonacci numbers
    If we are asked to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, we can do that with the following equation,
###  
    Fib(n) = Fib(n-1) + Fib(n-2), for n > 1    
### Characteristics of Dynamic Programming
#### 1. Overlapping Subproblems
        Subproblems are smaller versions of the original problem, 
        Take the example of the Fibonacci numbers; to find the fib(4)
